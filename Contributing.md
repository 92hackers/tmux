## Source code and development process

tmux is part of the OpenBSD base system and OpenBSD CVS is the primary source
repository:

https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/tmux/

GitHub holds the portable tmux version. There are a few minor differences,
mostly for portability.

Code changes to the main tmux code are committed to OpenBSD and then a script
automatically applies any new commits to the GitHub repository every few hours.

It is fine to develop and submit code changes with a GitHub PR, but the final
form will be a patch file which is applied to OpenBSD CVS.

## Releases

tmux currently sees a new release approximately every six months - the same
schedule as OpenBSD, around May and October. This means that the GitHub
releases contain roughly the same code as OpenBSD releases (but not necessarily
exactly the same).

The release process consists of a branch from which one or more release
candidates are produced for testing, until the final release is published and
the branch removed.

## Code contributions

Here is a list of outstanding feature requests or notes for future development.
They are sorted into three sections approximately by difficulty of
implementation. If there is a GitHub issue then its number is shown in
brackets.

It is worth getting in touch before starting work, particularly on larger
items, to avoid any duplication of effort.

### Small things

- It is annoying that -t= is still needed for select-window on the status line
  when it is not needed for panes.

- "After" hooks are missing for many commands that do not use CMD_AFTERHOOK.

- A command in copy mode to toggle the selection.

- new-window, respawn-window, split-window and so on have -e to add environment
  variables - new-session should have this too.

### Medium things

- list-keys should be able to show long commands with {} and newlines more
  nicely. Could store knowledge of command arguments in cmd_entry like a string
  with a character per argument - so if-shell might be "sTT" for shell-command
  and two tmux command. Would need syntax to express the different forms -
  new-window, bind-key, run-shell, if-shell, display-menu. Also what about
  stuff like popup -R and detach -E?

- Should remember the last layout before select-layout was used and
  select-layout without an argument should include it, so C-Space could cycle
  through it with the preset layouts. Also a separate flag or layout name to
  restore it directly.

- wait-for could do more, for example being able to wait for a pane to exit or
  close (could use the existing notify code in some way). Also a flag for a
  timeout or to stop waiting on a signal.

- ([#1784](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1784)) A way to disable line
  wrap but preserve any trimmed content (so it can be viewed if the pane is
  made bigger).

- Moving, joining and otherwise reorganizing panes, windows and session should
  be easier in tree mode. For example, either a new key to swap tagged panes if
  two are tagged, or tagged pane and current if one is tagged, and so on. Or
  make :swap-pane use tagged panes but that might be much harder. Likewise for
  move, join, etc. Also dragging would be nice.

- ([#1605](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1605)) Support for ZERO WIDTH
  JOINER U+200D.

- Marked positions in history. Could use the same prompt-detection escape
  sequences as iTerm2. Could be listed by capture-pane and also a menu to jump
  to marks in copy mode. ([#1042](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1042)) is
  related and also has some code to display a marker line.

- Make the commmand prompt able to take up multiple lines.

- ([#918](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/918)) A way to specify how panes
  are merged when one is killed. Could be an option to kill-pane.

- Allow multiple targets either with multiple -t or by giving a pattern or both.

- It would be nice to be able to remember the position in copy mode and go back
  to the same place when entering it again. How would this work if the pane
  scrolls? What about entering with the mouse?

- It would be nice to have commands to build a paste buffer in copy mode by
  doing multiple copies. It would need to display the work in progress
  somewhere (bottom left?) and have a command to add a chunk of text and a
  command to remove the last chunk and a command to clear.

- The lexer in cmd-parse.y should be a single state machine rather than separate
  functions for environment variables, strings and formats.

- ([#1868](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1868)) Vertical-only zoom.

- ([#1774](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1774)) Resizing panes should
  move to the parent cell and resize it if this would allow the pane to
  become closer to what is requested.

- ([#2028](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2028)) Style strings should be
  saved and parsed when they are used if they contain #{, so that formats can
  be emdedded in styles.

### Large things

- Better layouts. For example it would be good if they were driven by hints
  rather than fixed positions and could be automatically reapplied after
  resize/split/kill. Pane options can be used.

- ([#1269](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1269)) Store grids in
  blocks. Can be used to reflow on demand. Would be nice to revisit how
  history-limit works - would it be better as a global limit rather than per
  pane?

- Link panes into multiple windows.

- Separate active panes for different clients.

- ([#44](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/44)) &
  ([#1613](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1613)) Support for SIXEL.
