### Welcome to tmux!

tmux is a terminal multiplexer.  It lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and reattach them to a different terminal. And do a lot more. See [the tmux(1) manual page](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/tmux.1) and [the README](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/.github/README.md).

**Download [tmux 2.9 here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/2.9/tmux-2.9.tar.gz)** ([changes in this version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmux/tmux/2.9/CHANGES)).

For support see [the FAQ](FAQ) or contact the [tmux-users@googlegroups.com mailing list](mailto:tmux-users@googlegroups.com) or [#tmux IRC channel on freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/tmux).

tmux depends on [libevent](http://libevent.org) and [ncurses](http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/).

There are many online introductions to tmux (some are [here](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course) and [here](http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/)) and a few books (including [a nice online book](https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read)).

Some notes on tmux development and ideas for contributions are [here](Contributing).
